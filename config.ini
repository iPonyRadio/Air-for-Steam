config.ini {

//	Welcome to config.ini. This is your one-stop-shop for small interface modifications.
//
//	Each section contains a few options that you may choose between. You may only
//	activate one from each section at a time, so please make sure to follow
//	the directions carefully.
//
//	A double slash " // " at the beginning of a line denotes a comment, essentially
//	a line of code that will be ignored by Steam. For each section, choose one option
//	you would like to enable and simply remove the // from the beginning of that line.
//	YOU MUST then add a // to the beginning of each other line in that current section.
//
//	Once you're done, save this file and restart Steam.


	//	Themes
	//	_______

	//	This section will change the main color theme of Air.
	//	Please choose one option below and delete the 2 forward slashes " // " at the start of that line.
	//	When you are done, make sure every OTHER line in this section is commented out.

	//	!! IMPORTANT !!
	//	If you have not already copied the theme contents out of the +Extras folder, please
	//	read the full walkthrough here: https://github.com/Elundris/Air-for-Steam/wiki#themes
